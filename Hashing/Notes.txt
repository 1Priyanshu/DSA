1)Open Addressing:

-All keys are stored in hash table itself.
-closed hashing
-based on probing, collisions are removed from probing.

Linear Probing:
	-The interval between probes is fixed at 1. In linear probing, we search the hash table sequentially,starting from the original hash 	location.

		rehash(key) = (n + 1)% tablesize.


Quadratic Probing:

		rehash(key) = (n + k^2)% tablesize.

Double Hasghing:
	-Collision resolving technique.

		(hash1(key) + i * hash2(key)) % TABLE_SIZE 
		 hash2(key) = PRIME â€“ (key % PRIME) ; where PRIME is a prime smaller than the TABLE_SIZE.

Bloom filter:

	-A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure which was designed to check whether an element
	is present in a set with memory and time efficiency
	
	-Based on Bit vector data structure.
